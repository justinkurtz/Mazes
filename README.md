Working through the Mazes for Programmers by Jamis Buck. You can find it [here](https://pragprog.com/book/jbmaze/mazes-for-programmers).

“About the Code The sample code and the examples in this book are all written in Ruby, but the algorithms and techniques used are definitely not Ruby-specific! This book could have been written just as well in Python, or C, or Java, or C#, or any other language. I hope the examples are written clearly enough that even if you aren’t familiar with Ruby, the concepts shine through. There’s plenty of room for experimentation, whether or not Ruby is your thing.

If you decide to follow along in Ruby, please make sure you’re using at least Ruby version 2.1, as the examples won’t all run on earlier Ruby versions.

All of the code examples in this book can be downloaded from the book’s website. This can save you a bit of time if you’d rather not rekey an entire grid framework by hand—although that’s certainly an effective way to learn something!”
